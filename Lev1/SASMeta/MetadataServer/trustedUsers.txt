;This file contains a list of userids that are trusted to
;obtain/free/use credential handles representing other users.  
;A "TrustedUser" represents the UserID for a connection
;between a client and the Open Metadata Server, where the 
;client requires OMS Authorization Facility Credentials services.
;For example, a Middleware Server (acting as an OMS client) 
;commonly authenticates a user directly, obtains a
;credential handle from the OMS Authorization Facility for this user, 
;and then requests metadata from the OMS using the credential handle.
;Only clients that connect to the OMS with UserIDs registered in
;trustedUsers.txt may perform operations on behalf of other Users
;using credential handles.
;
;Each line of this file contains a single UserID entry.  The entries 
;may be in the following forms:  'userid', 'domain\userid', 'userid@domain'.
;A semicolon at the beginning of a line indicates that the line is 
;not to be processed.
